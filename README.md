### Event-driven statistical arbitrage
#### Project Review
In quantitative investment and trading, statistical arbitrage has gained prominence as a sophisticated strategy. Traditional models in this space excel in hedging market and sector risks, but often fall short in addressing company-specific risks, particularly during high-volatility periods like earnings release dates.

Our research project introduces an innovative approach to statistical arbitrage, refining a baseline benchmark model and infusing it with advanced features. The core enhancements include: feature Extraction,
Multi-Collinearity Detection,Statistical Arbitrage Strategy Optimization, Weighted Event-Based Filter. 

This repository contains the code, data analysis scripts, and documentation of our research. It serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and replicating our enhanced statistical arbitrage model.
